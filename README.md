# Escape-from-Tarkov-Range-Utility
This tool was made in order to find effective ranges in the maps in Escape From Tarkov.

Left-click to select a starting point, left click again to set a point for range or move around to dynamically get ranges.
Right clicking resets the points.

_This tool is very much a work in progress!_

# TO-DO
* Add support for maps other than customs
* Add web-gui for map selection
* Refactor distance formula to be more accurate (works with Customs, might not work with other maps)
* Clean up line and distance graphics
